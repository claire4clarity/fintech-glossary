# Fintech Technical Glossary
Welcome to my technical glossary.  This project is a living document where I translate complex financial concepts into chear, developer-friendly documentation.

## Core Concepts

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An **API** acts as a bridge between two software programs.  In Fintech, APIs allow your bank to talk to apps like *Venmo* or *Stripe* securely.

### KYC (Know Your Customer)
**KYC** is a mandatory process where businesses verify the identity of their clients.
* **Purpose:** To prevent money laundering and fraud.
* **Key Step:** Validating government-issed IDs.

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
A set of security standards designed to ensure that **all** companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.

### Blockchain
A distributed, decentralized ledger technology.   In Fintech, it is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively.

### SaaS (Software as a Service)
A software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.  Most modern Fintech tools (like *QuickBooks Online*) are SaaS.
