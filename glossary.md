## FinTech Lexicon

### Acquiring Bank
A financial institution that maintains a merchant's bank account. They are the "muscle" behind the merchant, enabling them to accept credit and debit card payments by acting as a middleman between the merchant and the card networks (like Visa or Mastercard).

### Application Programming Interface (API)

A set of protocols that allows two software applications to communicate with each other.  In the FinTech context, they allow an Acquiring Bank to securely ask an Issuing Bank whether the customer/client has sufficient funds to send the payment.
